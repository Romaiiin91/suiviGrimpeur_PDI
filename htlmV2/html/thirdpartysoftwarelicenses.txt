Appendix A

  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  		       Version 2, June 1991
  
   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  			    Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
  rights.
  
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the software.
  
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.
  
  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
  along with the Program.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.
  
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Program.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
  
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
  
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in full compliance.
  
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.
  
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.
  
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
  
  			    NO WARRANTY
  
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.
  
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
  
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
  when it starts in an interactive mode:
  
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
  
  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
  
    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
  
  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
  Public License instead of this License.

                         Version 3, 29 June 2007
  
   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
                              Preamble
  
    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
  software and other kinds of works.
  
    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
  freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
  or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
  know their rights.
  
    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
  
    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
  that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
  authors of previous versions.
  
    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
  can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
  protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
  products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
  
    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
  make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.
  
                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
    0. Definitions.
  
    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
  
    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.
  
    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
  
    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
  
    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  on the Program.
  
    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  public, and in some countries other activities as well.
  
    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
  
    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
  
    1. Source Code.
  
    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
  form of a work.
  
    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
  is widely used among developers working in that language.
  
    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
  
    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
  subprograms and other parts of the work.
  
    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
  Source.
  
    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
  same work.
  
    2. Basic Permissions.
  
    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
  
    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
  
    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
  makes it unnecessary.
  
    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
  
    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
  measures.
  
    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
  technological measures.
  
    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
  
    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
  
    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
  
    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
  
    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
      it, and giving a relevant date.
  
      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
      released under this License and any conditions added under section
      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
      "keep intact all notices".
  
      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
  
      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
      work need not make them do so.
  
    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
  parts of the aggregate.
  
    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
  
    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
  in one of these ways:
  
      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
      customarily used for software interchange.
  
      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
  
      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
      with subsection 6b.
  
      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
  
      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
      charge under subsection 6d.
  
    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  included in conveying the object code work.
  
    A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
  the only significant mode of use of the product.
  
    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
  modification has been made.
  
    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
  been installed in ROM).
  
    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
  protocols for communication across the network.
  
    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
  unpacking, reading or copying.
  
    7. Additional Terms.
  
    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
  this License without regard to the additional permissions.
  
    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
  
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
  
      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
  
      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
      Notices displayed by works containing it; or
  
      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
  
      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or
  
      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
  
      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
      those licensors and authors.
  
    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
  restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
  not survive such relicensing or conveying.
  
    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
  where to find the applicable terms.
  
    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
  the above requirements apply either way.
  
    8. Termination.
  
    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
  paragraph of section 11).
  
    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after the cessation.
  
    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
  your receipt of the notice.
  
    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
  material under section 10.
  
    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
  
    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
  
    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
  
    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
  
    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
  
    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
  
    11. Patents.
  
    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
  
    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
  this License.
  
    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
  propagate the contents of its contributor version.
  
    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
  sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
  patent against the party.
  
    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
  license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
  country that you have reason to believe are valid.
  
    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
  work and works based on it.
  
    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
  
    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
  
    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
  
    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
  
    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
  
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
  combination as such.
  
    14. Revised Versions of this License.
  
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.
  
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
  by the Free Software Foundation.
  
    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
  to choose that version for the Program.
  
    Later license versions may give you additional or different
  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
  later version.
  
    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
  
    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
  IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    16. Limitation of Liability.
  
    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.
  
    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
  
    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
  copy of the Program in return for a fee.
  
                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  
      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.
  
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
  
      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
      This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
  
  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
  
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
  
    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
  into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
  the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
  Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
  <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

Appendix F

  		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  		       Version 2, June 1991
  
   Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                      675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
   numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
  
  			    Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
  
    This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
  other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
  your libraries, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
  you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
  with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  
    Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
  the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  
    Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
  version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
  the original authors' reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
  software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
  transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
  we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
  free use or not licensed at all.
  
    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
  GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
  license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
  designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
  one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
  the same as in the ordinary license.
  
    The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
  they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
  program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
  changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
  analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
  a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
  derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
  treats it as such.
  
    Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
  Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
  sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
  concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
  
    However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
  users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
  libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
  permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
  preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
  libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
  this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
  changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
  will lead to faster development of free libraries.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
  former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
  works together with the library.
  
    Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
  General Public License rather than by this special one.
  
  		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
  General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
  addressed as "you".
  
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
  
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.
  
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.
  
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
  
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
      in the event an application does not supply such function or
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
      its purpose remains meaningful.
  
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
      root function must still compute square roots.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.
  
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.
  
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
  
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
  
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
  
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
  
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.
  
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
  of these things:
  
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
      to use the modified definitions.)
  
      b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
      least three years, to give the same user the materials
      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
      than the cost of performing this distribution.
  
      c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
      specified materials from the same place.
  
      d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
  the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.
  
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
  
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
      Sections above.
  
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.
  
    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.
  
    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.
  
  			    NO WARRANTY
  
    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.
  
  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
       Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  
    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).
  
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  
      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
      version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
  
      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU

      You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
      Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

   Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
   as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
   the version number 2.1.]
  
                              Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
  
    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
  below.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  
    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  
    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
  
    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.
  
    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.
  
    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.
  
    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
  becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must
  be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
  
    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.
  
    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
  
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
  compilation and installation of the library.
  
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.
  
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
  
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
      in the event an application does not supply such function or
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
      its purpose remains meaningful.
  
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
      root function must still compute square roots.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.
  
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.
  
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
  
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
  
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
  
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
  
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.
  
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
  of these things:
  
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
      to use the modified definitions.)
  
      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
  
      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
      three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
      Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
      performing this distribution.
  
      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
      specified materials from the same place.
  
      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.
  
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
  
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
      Sections above.
  
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.
  
    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  
    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.
  
                              NO WARRANTY
  
    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.
  
                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  
    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
  of the ordinary General Public License).
  
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
  have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
  notice is found.
  
  
      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  
      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
  
      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
      Lesser General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
  your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
  if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
    library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  
    This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
  the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
  License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
  
    0. Additional Definitions. 
  
    As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
  General Public License.
  
    "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
  
    An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
  by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
  of using an interface provided by the Library.
  
    A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
  Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
  Version".
  
    The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
  
    The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
  and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
  
    1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
  
    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
  
    2. Conveying Modified Versions.
  
    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
  version:
  
     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
     ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
     function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
     whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
  
     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
     this License applicable to that copy.
  
    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
  
    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
  code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
  (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
  
     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by this License.
  
     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.
  
    4. Combined Works.
  
    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  the following:
  
     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
     the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by this License.
  
     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.
  
     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
     execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
     these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
     copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
  
     d) Do one of the following:
  
         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
         License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
         suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
         recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
         the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
         manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
         Corresponding Source.
  
         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
         Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
         a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
         system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
         of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
         Version. 
  
     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
     be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
     GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
     necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
     Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
     Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
     you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
     the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
     Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
     Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
     for conveying Corresponding Source.)
  
    5. Combined Libraries.
  
    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  choice, if you do both of the following:
  
     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
     on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
     conveyed under the terms of this License.
  
     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
     is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  
    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
  
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
  
    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
  apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
  permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
  Library.

Appendix J

  The Academic Free License
  v. 2.1
  
  This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original
  work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor")
  has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright
  notice for the Original Work:
  
  Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
  
  1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a
  world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable
  license to do the following:
  
  a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
  
  b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the
  Original Work;
  
  c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to
  the public;
  
  d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
  
  e) to display the Original Work publicly.
  
  2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
  royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under
  patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
  the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and
  offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.
  
  3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
  preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and
  all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
  Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the
  Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original
  Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
  this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
  in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
  inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
  continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the
  address of that information repository in a notice immediately
  following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
  
  4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor
  the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
  trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
  products derived from this Original Work without express prior written
  permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
  grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
  any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated
  herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to
  sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
  defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of
  Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
  in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
  licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work
  that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
  
  5) This section intentionally omitted.
  
  6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
  Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark
  notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any
  notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
  "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any
  Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution
  Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
  modified the Original Work.
  
  7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor
  warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent
  rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are
  sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission
  of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
  expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original
  Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT
  WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
  the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
  WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
  part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder
  except under this disclaimer.
  
  8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
  theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
  otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct,
  indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
  character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
  Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
  all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability
  shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting
  from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
  limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
  limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
  and limitation may not apply to You.
  
  9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the
  Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort
  under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
  the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another
  written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to
  create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise
  any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do
  so except under the terms of this License (or another written
  agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by
  U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by
  international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights
  granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of
  this License and all of its terms and conditions.
  
  10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
  automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted
  to You by this License as of the date You commence an action,
  including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any
  licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This
  termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent
  infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
  or hardware.
  
  11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating
  to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
  wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary
  business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
  conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
  expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of
  this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
  requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101
  et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international
  treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
  
  12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License
  or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
  entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
  limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
  connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This
  section shall survive the termination of this License.
  
  13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
  concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
  is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to
  the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
  
  14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this
  License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a
  legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the
  terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity
  that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
  you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power,
  direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
  entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
  percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
  ownership of such entity.
  
  15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not
  otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and
  Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such
  uses by You.
  
  This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights
  reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this
  license without modification. This license may not be modified without
  the express written permission of its copyright owner.

  work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject to the terms of
  this Apple Public Source License version 2.0 ("License"). As used in
  this License:
  
  1.1 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean: (a) in the case where Apple is
  the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter
  acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject
  matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent
  necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code
  without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of
  rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired,
  owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your

  not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication
  with a client other than You.
  
  1.5 "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions
  thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.
  
  1.6 "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change
  to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous
  Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous

  and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program
  statements that contains any part of Covered Code.
  
  1.7 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other
  work as originally made available by Apple under this License,
  including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs
  or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been
  expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such
  work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and
  originally made available by Apple under this License.
  
  1.8 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other
  work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all
  modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
  scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable
  (object code).

  (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of
  such entity.
  
  2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms
  and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on
  the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a
  world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of
  Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original
  Code, to do the following:
  
  2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform,
  internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy
  verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or
  non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:
  
  (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the
  copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as
  they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the
  Original Code that refer to this License; and
  
  (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source
  Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally
  Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code
  that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights
  hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.
  
  2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce,
  display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and
  Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial
  or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also
  meet all of these conditions:
  
  (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to
  the Source Code of the Covered Code;
  
  (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the
  notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your
  Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
  stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and
  
  (c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make
  Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either
  available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your
  Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your Externally
  Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in
  this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3
  below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve
  (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is
  longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your
  Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a
  web site).
  
  2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You
  Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in
  object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent
  notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation,
  stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the
  terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such
  Source Code.
  
  2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that
  although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their
  respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no
  assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered
  Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
  rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any
  liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
  infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
  condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You
  hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
  license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is
  Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
  Covered Code.
  
  3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the
  licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any
  person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this
  License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license,
  under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property
  rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use,
  reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and
  Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as
  Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.
  
  4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
  Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance,
  You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
  the Covered Code or any portion thereof.
  
  5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in
  Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by
  Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional
  patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole
  discretion.
  
  6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other
  rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein
  ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole
  responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You
  must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms
  are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend
  and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by
  reason of any such Additional Terms.
  
  7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new
  versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given
  a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published
  under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it
  under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
  Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this
  License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to
  modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
  License.
  
  8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in
  part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered
  Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and
  may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge
  and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at
  Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
  WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND
  APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE
  PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
  ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
  NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF
  MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
  PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST
  INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE
  FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
  THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
  ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO
  ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE
  AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.
  You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the
  operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication
  systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of
  the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
  physical or environmental damage.
  
  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
  EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
  SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
  TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR
  ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY,
  TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF
  APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
  REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF
  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
  TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all
  damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this
  License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
  
  10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the
  trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac", "Mac OS",
  "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks,
  service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively
  "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name
  belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in
  or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or
  to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other
  than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times
  with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted
  at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.
  
  11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License,
  each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
  Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights,
  title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications
  made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple
  Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple
  may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple
  Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those
  contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.
  
  12. Termination.
  
  12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
  terminate:
  
  (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with
  any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30
  days of becoming aware of such breach;
  
  (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
  13.5(b); or
  
  (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during
  the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
  against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence
  an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.
  
  12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately
  stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and
  distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code
  which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive
  any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature,
  should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
  survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11,
  12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation,
  indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating
  this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this
  License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of
  any party.
  
  13. Miscellaneous.
  
  13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as
  defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in
  the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the
  public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license
  in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR
  12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for
  Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data --
  Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer
  Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S.
  Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
  forth herein.
  
  13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as
  creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
  legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and
  You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by
  implication, appearance or otherwise.
  
  13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair
  Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for
  it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the
  same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,
  Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may
  develop, produce, market or distribute.
  
  13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to
  enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of
  future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or
  regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
  construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.
  
  13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent
  jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,
  to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to
  the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits
  and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will
  continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
  if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
  specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the
  enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will
  immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of
  the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your
  possession or control.
  
  13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution
  between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the
  Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to
  the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal
  courts within that District with respect to this License. The
  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
  International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
  
  13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the
  entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
  matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the
  United States and the State of California, except that body of
  California law concerning conflicts of law.
  
  Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
  clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested
  that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les
  parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents
  connexes soient rediges en anglais.

Appendix T

  This file is part of the OpenSSH software.
  
  The licences which components of this software fall under are as
  follows.  First, we will summarize and say that all components
  are under a BSD licence, or a licence more free than that.
  
  OpenSSH contains no GPL code.
  
  1)
       * Copyright (c) 1995 Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi>, Espoo, Finland
       *                    All rights reserved
       *
       * As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
       * can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
       * software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
       * incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
       * called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".
  
      [Tatu continues]
       *  However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or
       * copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that
       * are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included
       * source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements
       * and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most
       * restrictive); see below for details.
  
      [However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time.  All of
      these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about
      have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,
  
       - RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library
       - IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated
       - DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library
       - GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL
       - Zlib is now external, in a library
       - The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included
       - TSS has been removed
       - MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library
       - RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL
       - Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library
  
      [The licence continues]
  
      Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
      software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
      bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.  More
      information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".

      permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
      You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
      making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in
      your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.
  
  
  			    NO WARRANTY
  
      BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
      FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
      OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
      PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
      OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
      WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
      REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
      INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
      OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
      TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
      YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER

                      The FreeType Project LICENSE
                      ----------------------------
  
                              2006-Jan-27
  
                      Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
            David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
  
  
  
  Introduction
  ============
  
    The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
    various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
    FreeType Project.
  
    This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
    which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
    affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
  
    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
  
      o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
        interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
  
      o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
        full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
  
      o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
        it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
        somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
        FreeType code. (`credits')
  
    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
  
  
    Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
    encourage you to use the following text:
  
     """  
      Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
      Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
     """
  
    Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
    actually use.
  
  
  Legal Terms
  ===========
  
  0. Definitions
  --------------
  
    Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
    and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
    distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
    beta or final release.
  
    `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
    engine'.
  
    This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.
  
    The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
    specified below.
  
  1. No Warranty
  --------------
  
    THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
    WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
  
  2. Redistribution
  -----------------
  
    This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
    irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
    display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
    sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
    forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
    authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
    herein, subject to the following conditions:
  
      o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
        (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
        the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
        documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
        original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
        files.
  
      o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
        states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
        FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
        encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
        documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
  
    These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
    the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
    our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
    to us.
  
  3. Advertising
  --------------
  
    Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
    the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
    purposes without specific prior written permission.
  
    We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
    following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
    or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
    `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
  
    As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
    accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
    material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
    authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
    Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
    Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
    of this license.
  
  4. Contacts
  -----------
  
    There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
  
      o freetype@nongnu.org
  
        Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
        future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
        If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
        haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
  
      o freetype-devel@nongnu.org
  
        Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
        specific licenses, porting, etc.
